This capstone project represents the comprehensive synthesis and application of knowledge acquired throughout the various modules and laboratories of the data science course, focusing on the analysis of the SpaceX data set. The purpose of the presentation is to draw a cohesive narrative that reflects the educational journey through the different aspects of data science explored in this project.

The primary focus of the research will be predicting the landing success of the Falcon 9 first stage, an essential component in the space launch economy. SpaceX, by reusing the first stage, has managed to significantly reduce costs, offering competitive launches with substantial savings compared to other providers. The ability to accurately predict whether the first stage will land successfully has direct implications in determining the total cost of a launch, valuable information for companies considering competing with SpaceX in bidding for rocket launches.

The methodology to collect data will be based on the use of a RESTful API and web scraping techniques to obtain detailed information on the landings of the first stage of the Falcon 9. This data will be transformed into a data frame and will be subjected to various manipulations to ensure its suitability for analysis.

The presentation will include an interactive approach by creating a dashboard using Plotly Dash to dynamically analyze release logs. Additionally, Folium will be used to build an interactive map, providing a spatial visualization that will explore the geographic proximity of launch sites.

The application of machine learning techniques will be a key component of the analysis, with the goal of determining the probability of successful landing of the first stage of the Falcon 9. This process will involve dividing the data into training and test sets, followed by the search for the best hyperparameters for algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), classification trees and logistic regression.

In summary, this capstone project offers a comprehensive and applied view of the skills acquired in the field of data science, addressing real-world challenges in the space industry and demonstrating the ability to use various tools and techniques for informed decision making.
